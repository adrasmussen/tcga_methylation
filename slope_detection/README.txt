Prior to actually seeing the data, we did some exploration with slope-finding neural nets.

Methylation is detected by examining the 'upstream' and 'downstream' slopes in the methylation density along the DNA strand.

If the data were precise enough to see these slopes directly, then the neural net would need to be able to locate and measure these slopes.

So, as a warmup excercise, I created and tested an algorithm to find those slopes.
